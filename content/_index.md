Hello my name is Matt DiBiaso I'm a cloud security engineer with over 10 years of experience in the IT industry, I have a strong security-first mindset and extensive knowledge in network optimization, IT infrastructure development, and technical support management across various industries. My professional expertise includes providing technology services, deployment and administration, networking and configuration, strategic planning and forecasting, mobile device management, cloud computing, workflow optimization, performance analysis, troubleshooting and testing, user support and service, business and technical documentation, team training and development, and cross-team coordination.

I am skilled in using effective communication and negotiation skills, as well as business acumen, systems analysis, project management, and resource management to deliver superior administration and achieve maximum returns. In my current role as a Cloud Security Engineer at 2nd Watch, I am responsible for configuring, implementing, monitoring, and supporting network security software/systems that ensure compliance with the CSA Cloud Controls Matrix in cloud environments (AWS/Azure/GCP). I also update security tools for logging/monitoring and make recommendations to management on enhancements to existing and new security software or related tools.

I assist in evaluating, planning, and implementing new/existing security applications/tools that integrate with current tool sets, help implement and maintain next-generation enterprise protection tools and malware detection technologies, and ensure security standard methodologies are identified and integrated into all facets of projects including network, system designs/configuration, and implementations. In addition, I identify and recommend potential areas where existing data security policies and procedures require change or where a supplement is needed to mitigate key security risks, and work with various business units to enhance security policies/procedures. I also create and maintain data security documentation, policies, and procedures.

I am known as a progressive, driven, and down-to-earth professional with a strong analytical and strategic approach to network and systems administration. I am reliable and trusted to deliver superior solutions that have impactful results on time and under budget. I am always interested in connecting with former colleagues and managers, as well as other professionals in my field.
